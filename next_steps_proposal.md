# ProtoBase: Commercial Enhancement Proposal (2025 Refresh)

## Executive Summary

ProtoBase has made meaningful progress toward commercial readiness:
- LINQ-like query interface (linq.py) with lazy execution, explicit materializers, `explain()`, and fallback policies. This reduces onboarding friction and clarifies the execution model.
- Query engine with range operators (Between) and index-aware planning, enabling predicate pushdown and early limits.
- Immutable secondary indexes across core collections (List/Set/Dictionary) via `IndexRegistry`, supporting progressive intersection by selectivity.
- Vector search with ANN benchmarks (HNSW, IVF-Flat, exact) and recall/latency metrics. Solid foundation for hybrid pipelines (structured + vector).
- Documentation built with Sphinx, quickstart guide, and LINQ examples. Structure in place for expanding API docs and recipe-style guides.
- Test coverage spanning expressions, filters, group-by, basic joins, and range operators.

Product thesis: “Declarative, lazy, and optimized queries in Python—LINQ ergonomics with an embedded, index-aware engine and vector support.” Differentiation vs SQL/DataFrames: no external DBMS, no default full materialization; focus on programmatic, optimizable, and deterministic pipelines.

## Current State and Potential

- Execution model:
  - Lazy by default; materializers (`to_list`, `count`, `first`, aggregates) trigger execution.
  - `explain()` reveals the optimized plan and filter/index application order.
  - Policies `on_unsupported("error"|"warn"|"fallback")` govern expression translation and local fallback.

- Indexing and planning:
  - Equality, membership (in), text prefix, and range predicates are pushed to indexes.
  - AND uses progressive intersection by selectivity; OR uses union with deduplication.
  - Multi-dimensional filtering (2D/3D) via per-field set fusion; high potential for discretized geo/time-series scenarios.

- Vector/ANN:
  - KNN benchmarks: exact, HNSW, IVF-Flat; latency and recall metrics.
  - Vector API supports normalization and metrics (cosine/L2).
  - Potential: structured filters + vector top-k within the same pipeline (RAG/semantic search embedded).

- Documentation and DX:
  - Sphinx-based docs for API and guides.
  - Practical LINQ examples (filters, between, group_by, policies).
  - Foundation for “migration guides” from list comprehensions, pandas/Polars, or SQLAlchemy (to be completed).

- Security/authorization (approach):
  - Keep `proto_db` decoupled from business logic.
  - Authorization modeled as filter policies injected into the plan; permission pre-filters intersected via indexes.

Market potential:
- Embedded in Python apps (backend/edge) needing optimized queries without running a DBMS.
- AI/ML workflows combining structured attributes with local vector search.
  - ISVs and product teams valuing reproducibility, low operational complexity, and plan-level control.

## Key Differentiators

- Familiar ergonomics (LINQ-like) with Pythonic discipline (snake_case, type hints).
- Declarative, explainable optimization (explain, pushdown, early limits).
- Immutable indexes that are easy to reason about and replicate; selectivity-driven intersections.
- Embedded engine: simple to integrate, test, and ship.
- Vector search integrated into the same query model (no extra stack).

## Risks and Mitigations

- Expectation of 1:1 parity with LINQ:
  - Define/document the supported subset and roadmap; be explicit about translation limits and fallbacks.
- Costly Python fallback:
  - Strict defaults for policies, safety limits (rows/memory), and clear warnings; expose explainable decisions.
- Complexity for advanced joins/windowing:
  - Phase implementation: start with inner/left joins on simple keys and lightweight stats.
- “Yet another DSL” perception:
  - Emphasize explain, indexes, and vector/ANN as distinctive value; show real plans and measurable wins.

## Next Steps (6–9 months roadmap)

Phase A (0–6 weeks): Core parity and consolidation
- Make LINQ the sole high-level public API; keep queries (IR) as a stable internal representation.
- Complete core operators: `where`, `select`, `select_many`, `order_by/then_by`, `distinct`, `take/skip`, `group_by` with aggregates (`count/sum/min/max/avg`).
- Full Between support: inclusivity modes, types (int/float/datetime/string where order applies), chained lambda detection.
- Diagnostics: `explain(text/json)` with cost estimates, chosen indexes, and filter order.
- Policies: `on_unsupported` and safety limits (max local rows, memory, timeout).
- Docs: “If you come from LINQ, start here” and index/range recipes.

Phase B (6–12 weeks): Index stats and basic joins
- Lightweight per-index stats (cardinality, distribution) to improve filter ordering.
- Joins: `join(inner/left)` with simple keys and filter pushdown; `group_join` baseline.
- Set ops: `union`, `intersect`, `except` with efficient deduplication.
- Hints: `use_index(name)`, `no_index()`, and `on_no_index("error"|"warn"|"allow")`.
- Plan regression tests: compare `explain(json)` across versions.

Phase C (12–20 weeks): Vector + hybrid pipelines and hardening
- `nearest_neighbors` operator with pre/post structured filters and top-k.
- ANN tuning (efSearch/efConstruction, nprobe) with recall/latency metrics; show tradeoffs in explain.
- Profiling: `with_stats()` and `profile(materializer)` for per-operator timings.
- Authorization tooling: hook to inject permission pre-filters into `Queryable`.

Phase D (20–36 weeks): Commercial deliverables
- Packaging for deployment (Docker, CI templates) and integration guides (FastAPI/Flask).
- Advanced documentation (tuning, composite indexes, design patterns).
- Reference cases and reproducible benchmarks (storytelling with public datasets).

## Success Metrics

- Adoption/DX:
  - Time-to-first-result (quickstart) < 10 minutes; completion rate > 70%.
  - Share of fully translated queries (no fallback) > 80% in examples/docs.

- Performance:
  - Indexed speedup vs linear scan > 10x on datasets > 100k rows for typical AND+BETWEEN queries.
  - ANN: P95 latency under 10 ms for n=100k (local) with configurable recall ≥ 0.9.

- Technical quality:
  - Stable test coverage; growing plan-regression suites.
  - Public API stability with no unannounced breaking changes.

- Traction:
  - Organic growth (stars, downloads), issues from real users, feature requests.
  - 2–3 pilots/POCs (e.g., hybrid search, edge analytics).

## Go-to-Market (lightweight, developer-first)

- Narrative:
  - “Write queries like LINQ, execute like an optimized engine—no external database required.”
  - “Index-backed filters + vector search in the same pipeline.”

- Content:
  - Blog series on explain of real queries (before/after indexes; between; join).
  - Notebooks with reproducible benchmarks and known datasets.

- Integrations:
  - FastAPI examples (endpoints executing Queryable with explain) and ML feature pipelines.

- Community:
  - Contribution guide, “good first issue” labels, and a public roadmap.

## Security and Permissions

- Keep the engine agnostic to business logic: express authorization as predicates/pre-filters.
- Inject permission filters into the pipeline (`Queryable` hook) before planning.
- No-bypass tests: policies must be visible in `explain()` and preserved by reordering.

## Conclusion

ProtoBase is positioned to consolidate its promise: a familiar declarative API, an embedded optimizable engine, and integrated indexes and vector/ANN search. With a LINQ-first public interface, transparent explain, and focus on indexes/ranges/basic joins, the project can accelerate adoption and unlock hybrid (structured + semantic) use cases without operational complexity. The roadmap prioritizes immediate impact (DX, performance, explain) while preparing for advanced capabilities and sustainable commercial opportunities.

Se ha mejorado la documentación y las pruebas del proyecto. Para la construcción de un sistema de permisos, se ha decidido mantener `proto_db` fuera de la lógica de la aplicación.

Para lograr esto, se optimizarán las búsquedas para implementar un sistema de autorizaciones basado en filtros. Se implementará un conjunto de facilidades de indexado para todas las colecciones, con el objetivo de alcanzar un rendimiento comparable al de las bases de datos relacionales más comunes.

Se implementarán índices múltiples, basados en la fusión de conjuntos de resultados, lo que permitirá expandir las capacidades para manejar:
- Datos en 2D y 3D.
- Datos vectoriales con consultas de proximidad (por ejemplo, `x` entre 3 y 5, `y` entre 1 y 2, y `z` = 4).
- Consultas exactas que devuelvan conjuntos de objetos.
