# ProtoBase: Commercial Positioning (2025)

## Executive Summary

ProtoBase is an embedded, transactional, object-oriented database for Python that delivers a unified engine for structured and vector data—featuring a LINQ-like query API, immutable secondary indexes, range-aware optimization, and integrated vector similarity search. It enables developers to compose declarative, lazy, and optimized pipelines inside their Python process, without provisioning an external DBMS or stitching multiple systems for metadata + vectors.

Outcome: lower total cost of ownership, faster time-to-market, and a cohesive developer experience for AI-enabled products—particularly Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and semantic search—while preserving transactional consistency.

## Why ProtoBase, Why Now

- AI workloads increasingly require tight coupling of semantic search (vectors) with precise metadata filters and transactional writes.
- Typical stacks combine a vector DB, a document/KV store, a cache, and an indexing service—adding complexity and operational overhead.
- ProtoBase consolidates these needs into a single embedded engine: composable indexes, range operators, index-driven planning, and vector search in one place.

## Value Proposition

1) Embedded, LINQ-like Querying
   - Familiar, Pythonic LINQ-style API with lazy execution and explicit materializers.
   - `explain()` for transparent, explainable plans; pushdown of filters, ranges, and limits.

2) Transactional and Consistent
   - Copy-on-write and transactional rebase keep data and indexes (including vector indexes) consistent across updates.

3) Index-Driven Optimization
   - Immutable secondary indexes; selectivity-ordered intersections for AND predicates; union+dedupe for OR.
   - Range-aware operators with inclusive/exclusive bounds.

4) Vector-Native
   - Vector fields with KNN search (exact and ANN like IVF-Flat and HNSW).
   - Hybrid pipelines: combine similarity search with structured filters in the same query.

5) Operational Simplicity
   - Runs in-process; works with memory, file, distributed, or cloud backends via a unified API.
   - Deterministic, testable, and easy to package (developer-first).

## Target Segments

- Product teams building AI/RAG features in Python that need vector search + business filters with transactional guarantees.
- SaaS and startups optimizing for iteration speed and low TCO.
- Edge/IoT deployments requiring local inference, offline operation, and later synchronization.
- Data science/ML teams that prototype quickly and need a direct path to production without a separate DB stack.

## Competitive Landscape (Executive View)

- SQLite/DuckDB: excellent embedded engines; lack native transactional vector search and Python object semantics.
- Redis/MongoDB: strong services but higher operational footprint for embedded hybrid (vector + metadata) use cases.
- Vector DBs (FAISS, Chroma, pgvector): best-in-class similarity, but typically require separate systems for metadata and transactions.
- ProtoBase unifies: transactions + rich data structures + secondary and vector indexes + range-aware queries, all embedded in Python.

## Key Differentiators

1) Declarative, LINQ-like API with lazy, optimized execution (pushdown + early limits).
2) Immutable secondary indexes; reusability and predictable performance.
3) Range operators with configurable inclusivity: [], (), [), (].
4) Practical optimizer based on selectivity and early exit.
5) Integrated vector search (exact + ANN) composable with structured filters.
6) Transactional consistency across data and all indexes via copy-on-write and rebase.
7) Embedded simplicity with unified persistence (memory, file, cluster, cloud).

## Core Use Cases

- Embedded RAG: store embeddings, documents, and metadata; retrieve via KNN; filter by attributes/ranges; rerank and serve.
- Semantic search and recommendations with complex business rules in SaaS products.
- Deduplication/fuzzy matching where vector similarity and structural constraints must co-exist.
- Edge analytics with local semantic search and low-latency filters.

## Technical Capabilities

- LINQ-like Querying
  - Lazy pipelines; `where`, `select`, `select_many`, `order_by/then_by`, `distinct`, `take/skip`, `group_by` with aggregates.
  - Policies: `on_unsupported("error"|"warn"|"fallback")`; `explain(text/json)`.

- Secondary Indexes
  - Immutable maps of value → frozenset(object_id); incremental updates on add/remove/replace.
  - Selectivity-driven intersections; reuse across queries.

- Range Operators
  - Inclusive/exclusive bounds; detection from chained comparisons in lambdas.
  - Efficient pushdown to range-capable/ordered indexes or discretized buckets.

- Vector Search
  - Vector fields with dimension checks and optional normalization.
  - Exact, IVF-Flat, and (optionally) HNSW; recall and latency benchmarks available.
  - Hybrid: combine top-k vector results with indexed structured filters.

- Transactions and Persistence
  - Copy-on-write and rebase ensure data/index consistency.
  - Pluggable storage backends (local to cloud) under a single API.

## Business Benefits

- Reduced TCO: fewer services to provision, operate, and monitor.
- Faster time-to-market: one engine for structured + vector + transactions.
- Lower risk: explainable plans; consistent indexes; deterministic behavior.
- Portability: local dev to edge to cloud without rearchitecture.
