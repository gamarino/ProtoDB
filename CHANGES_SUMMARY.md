# Changes Made to Convert proto_db into a PyPI Package

This document summarizes the changes made to convert the proto_db project into a module that can be uploaded to the Python Package Index (PyPI).

## Files Created

1. **pyproject.toml**: Configuration file for the package, including metadata, dependencies, and build system information.
   - Defined package name, version, description, authors, license, and classifiers
   - Specified Python 3.11 as the minimum required version
   - Configured setuptools as the build backend

2. **LICENSE**: Added an MIT License file to clearly specify the terms under which the software can be used, modified, and distributed.

3. **MANIFEST.in**: Created to ensure that non-Python files (LICENSE, README.md) are included in the package distribution.

4. **test_install.py**: Script to test the local installation of the package, verifying that it can be installed and used correctly.

5. **PYPI_UPLOAD.md**: Documentation on how to build and upload the package to PyPI, including prerequisites, build instructions, testing procedures, and automation options.

## Files Modified

1. **README.md**: Updated to include:
   - Installation instructions for installing from PyPI
   - Alternative installation instructions for installing from source
   - License information with a link to the LICENSE file

## No Changes Required

1. **proto_db/__init__.py**: The existing file already properly imports and exposes the package's components, so no changes were needed.

## Next Steps

The proto_db package is now ready to be built and uploaded to PyPI. To do this:

1. Run the test_install.py script to verify that the package can be installed and used correctly:
   ```bash
   python test_install.py
   ```

2. Follow the instructions in PYPI_UPLOAD.md to build and upload the package to PyPI.

## Additional Recommendations

1. **Version Management**: Implement a versioning strategy for future releases.
2. **Continuous Integration**: Set up CI/CD pipelines to automate testing and deployment.
3. **Documentation**: Consider generating API documentation using tools like Sphinx.
4. **Contribution Guidelines**: Add detailed contribution guidelines to encourage community involvement.
